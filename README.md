**How to use github!**

1. Install Git
   
Most Macs already have Git installed. To check, open Terminal and run:

`git --version`

If you see a version number, Git is installed.
If you do not see a version number, install Git with Homebrew:

`brew install git`

If you do not have Homebrew, install it with:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

2. Open your terminal

3. Choose a folder for the project

Navigate to the folder where you want the repository to live. For example, to use your Documents folder:
`cd ~/Documents`

Replace Documents with any folder path you prefer.

5. Clone this repository

Click the green "Code" button and copy the GitHub CLI.
Paste that into your terminal.

Example:
`gh repo clone maltepes/repo-name`

This creates a new folder named repo-name with the project files.
